            Literature: In Charles Dickens’ “The Pickwick Papers,” he writes, “Miss Bolo rose from the table, considerably agitated, and went straight home, in a flood of tears and a sedan-chair.” Here, “went” applies to both “home” and “in a flood of tears,” creating a zeugma1.

            Everyday Speech: “She broke his car and his heart.” The verb “broke” applies to both “car” and “heart,” but in different senses2.
